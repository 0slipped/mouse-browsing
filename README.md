# MouseBrowsing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _MouseBrowsing_ allows mouse button navigation that would normally require the keyboard. 

> [!NOTE]
> _MouseBrowsing_ is originally designed for _Mozilla Firefox_ and mice with a back & forward button.

> [!CAUTION]
> _MouseBrowsing_ may also be used for other programs (at your own risk). If breaking occurs (glitched keys), then a _MouseBrowsing_ re-launch, keyboard reset, or computer restart may be necessary.
