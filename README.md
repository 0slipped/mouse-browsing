# Mouse Browsing

[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> _Mouse Browsing_ allows mouse button navigation that would normally require the keyboard. _Mouse Browsing_ was created with _AutoHotKey_ (AHK).

> [!NOTE]
> _Mouse Browsing_ is originally designed for _Mozilla Firefox_ and mice with a back & forward button.

> [!CAUTION]
> _Mouse Browsing_ may also be used for other programs (at your own risk). If breaking occurs (glitched keys), then a _Mouse Browsing_ re-launch, keyboard reset, or computer restart may be necessary.
