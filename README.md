# MouseBrowsing

## Description

_MouseBrowsing_ allows mouse button navigation that would normally require the keyboard. Originally designed for _Mozilla Firefox_, _MouseBrowsing_ may also be used for other programs (at your own risk). If breaking occurs (glitched keys), then a re-launch, keyboard reset, or computer restart may be necessary.
