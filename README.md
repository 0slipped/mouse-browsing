_MouseBrowsing_ allows you to perform keyboard-only navigation and editing functions.

> [!NOTE]
> _MouseBrowsing_ was originally designed for _Mozilla Firefox_ and mice with a back & forward button.
>
> Note: see _MASTER.md_ for a list of all the functions.
>
> Note: see _CHANGELOG.md_ for a list of all the edits.

> [!CAUTION]
> _MouseBrowsing_ may also be used for other programs (at your own risk). If breaking occurs (glitched keys), then a _MouseBrowsing_ re-launch, keyboard reset, or computer restart may be necessary.
